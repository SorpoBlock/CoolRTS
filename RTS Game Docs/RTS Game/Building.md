Building should be modular, just as there are no unit 'types' likewise buildings should start generic.

Building should be done by dragging a building tool across [[Map|tiles]] to get a section of building with the width and height you want, possibly joining other buildings to create complex shapes. Then you should be able to select the type of [[Resources|building material]] you want, i.e. stone or wood. At this point [[Citizens]] with the builder job would come and build it given the right materials.

Once the building itself has been built, you will be able to select what you want to furnish the building with. Adding household goods (pottery from clay? wood furniture?) turns the place into a [[Residence]] while adding machinery of various sorts turns the building into a factory. The larger the base building, the more stuff you can furnish the building with. 

When people are at their home or [[Jobs]] they will garrison the building and essentially disappear to save on performance, the building will light up or play an animation to indicate occupation. If a building is on fire or sufficiently damaged citizens will no longer be able to garrison or use the structure and will be tossed outside. 

Some buildings later in the game may require utilities like electricity or water to function.
