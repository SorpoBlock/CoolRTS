The foundation of your nation. Unlike normal RTS games you create military and resource gathering units simply by outfitting undifferentiated citizens with the [[Tools]] they need to do a certain job. 

Citizens need basic necessities just to [[Health|survive]], and in particularly harsh environments the early game may be battling just to survive the winter, to say nothing of combat with others. Citizens will take care of their survival needs automatically so long as the needed resources are available to them.

Each citizen will have a few traits they are born with:
[[Nationality]]
[[Strength]]

As well as certain traits that can be changed throughout their life:
[[Stamina]]
[[Health]]
[[Experience]]
[[Moral]]
[[Residence]]
[[Hunger]]
[[Warmth]]

New citizens will probably be created either through [[Immigration]] or through [[Birth]].

They can be assigned [[Jobs]] which they will do somewhat autonomously as well as certain [[Tasks]] which do not interrupt or change their job assignment. Military units will be those without a civilian job that have been given [[Tools|Weapons]].
