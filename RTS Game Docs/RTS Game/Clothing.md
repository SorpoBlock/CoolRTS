Units can wear one set of clothing at a time, and otherwise clothing types are [[Resources]] that can be stored in units' [[Residence]] or stock yards. [[Citizens]] will automatically store at least a type suitable winter clothing at their residence if it is available, or will store whatever clothing they had previously worn for use by their household. 

Types of clothing:
* Simple hide cloaks from starter animals for warmth
* Cotton or wool garments for warmth
* Armor:
	* Studded leather armor from leather/hide and some metal for a bit of protection from everything
	* Metal plate armor for use against melee attacks
	* Chainmail for use against early ranged attacks

Armor would probably become important early on and cease to be particularly useful as artillery and rifled ammunition become to primary [[Combat|dealers of damage]] in the late game. 
Chainmail and plate armor could be made from copper -> bronze -> iron -> steel in increasing order of quality/damage mitigation.

I don't know yet if there should be durability on tools and clothing, if done poorly it could be rather frustrating, and one will need to replace armor anyway due to [[Technology|advances in technology]] and unit losses. 

There possibly could be camouflage which reduces the accuracy of enemy ranged attacks and could be applied to wool/leather/cotton clothing.
