[[Citizens]] will be able to fight either in [[Formations]] or individually. They will be able to fight either by attacking enemies on sight depending on their formation's orders or by being ordered to attack explicitly. 

How a citizen attacks is determined by what [[Tools|weapon]] and ammo it is currently holding. Attacks that use ammo will require units to be periodically resupplied with additional ammo, or else they will fall back to (possibly unarmed) melee attacks. All attacks are of one of three types, melee, ranged, or siege. Spears, swords, and clubs are used for melee. Bows and guns are used for ranged, and siege covers anything that deals splash damage, such as catapults and grenades. 

Other forms of damage dealt in combat may include purposely spreading [[Disease]] and setting [[Building|buildings]] on fire which could spread, not to mention purposely cutting off a towns food or water supplies. 

For melee, the damage dealt is straight forward, the greater [[Strength]], [[Moral]], and [[Health]] a Citizen has, as well as the [[Experience]] it has with that particular type of weapon determine how much damage they do to the one unit they are currently attacking. [[Stamina]] will be used up with attacks and the unit will pause attacking when it hits zero. 

For ranged damage, hopefully projectile attacks will be simulated with some degree of actual targeting and physics. In this case the main factor determining overall damage will be accuracy. A citizens [[Moral]] and [[Experience]] with that particular gun along with the type of gun itself (i.e. rifled or unrifled, propellant) will determine accuracy. Things like strength and health will have a much reduced effect (if any) on ranged attacks, and the stamina use will be minimal. 

Siege attacks are those that deal splash damage. Units can be given grenades of various types and their formation will have their use policy set for them, or they can be ordered to throw grenades at a location manually. There will also be siege units such as catapults, cannons, and howitzers. 

Units will also be able to be fitted with at least a few types of [[Clothing|armor]] that may decrease movement speed or increase stamina usage, but reduce different types of damage. 

There will be a [[Map|fog of war]] where the players of a nation will only be able to see the totality of what its Citizens can currently see. There should be minimal or no visibility of map regions without a friendly unit there. Line of sight should be blocked by terrain and buildings, such that you can hide units behind buildings for an ambush. Bushes could be used to temporarily hide individual units.
