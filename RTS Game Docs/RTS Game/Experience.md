A modifier that is reset upon assigning new [[Jobs]] to [[Citizens]].

In civilian jobs, experience slowly accrues the more the citizen performs that job. It generally will allow citizens to perform jobs more quickly or to use less [[Resources]] while performing them.

In military assignments, experience is reset when a citizen is assigned different weapons / a different load-out. The experience then is specific to a type of [[Tools|weapon]] and [[Formations|formation]]. Armies may be drilled while not in combat to get experience to a certain point. Experience will also be gained upon engaging with other units in combat.
