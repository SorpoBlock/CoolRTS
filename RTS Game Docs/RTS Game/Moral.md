Moral will decrease if:
* A citizen has [[Hunger]], is [[Warmth|cold]], or has low [[Health]] 
* A citizen has recently experienced one of these things
* A citizen is near other citizens that are experiencing these things
* A citizen has been near other citizens dying
* A citizen has not been to their [[Residence|home]] in a very long time

Moral increases slowly over time so long as nothing would cause it to decrease. [[Luxury Goods]] can speed up this increase.

Moral affects:
* Accuracy (ranged) or damage (melee) of combat
* Unit speed
* Units with no moral will not obey orders and may instead just go home or tend to other needs
