When the game starts, each player will get to name their fictional nation. 
They will spawn with a certain number of starter [[Citizens]] based on the [[Gamemodes]] selected.

These citizens will all be purely of the players nationality. 
However as the game progresses you may come to control units of other player's either [[Immigration|peacefully]] or [[Diplomacy|forcibly]]. 
If these units [[Birth|interbreed]] with units of your own nationality they will create populations of mixed heritage. 
Normally citizens will automatically pair off with each other at adulthood, however you may set [[Policies]] which encourage, allow, or prohibit intermarriage with a given nationality. (I feel like even if you prohibit it there should still be a small chance for it to happen based on proximity.)

Each nationality will have a collective sentiment towards your nation that is based on your dealings with their home nation and how you treat the citizens of their nationality you control. The worse the sentiment, the less of that nationality will be required in a given citizen in order to make them work slower or even commit sabotage.
