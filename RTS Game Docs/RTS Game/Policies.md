Similar to Cities Skylines, I imagine a tool where you can draw 'districts' on the map and name them. You can then set certain policies for each region.

Possible policies include:
Encouraging / prohibiting / allowing intermarriage. (See: [[Birth]] and [[Nationality]])
Prohibiting or encouraging [[Diplomacy|trade]] in certain [[Resources]] or with certain nations
Encouraging or prohibiting certain resources to be stockpiled in an area
Encouraging or restricting births in general
