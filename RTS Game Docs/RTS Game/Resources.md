Possible resources include:
* Wood - Firewood for homes, [[Building]] material, minor ingredient in early [[Tools]], charcoal
* Coal / Charcoal - Mined or created for use in processing metal in early game, heating homes*
* [[Mining|Rocks and metals]] including both ore and processed metal
	* Stone - Creating structures, really early tools
	* Clay - Creating bloomeries, retooling buildings to be homes (i.e. household goods)
	* Copper - Common and earliest metal for tools, may be used later for electrical wires
	* Tin - Rare and combined with copper for much better tools
	* Iron/Steel - Common ore but much harder to work with?
	* Gold - Maybe used for trade? I doubt the gold standard would work in a video game lol unless there's a practical use for it
	* Chormium or something for very late game steel 
* [[Food]] of two main kinds:
	* Farmed - Consistent food production using experience and buildings
	* Starting food - Berries, wildlife, easy low quantity super early game food
* [[Luxury Goods]]
	* Can be made in different ways, but consolidate to a single resource for simplicity
	* Gems can be mined and turned into luxury goods
	* Spices can be grown or found in certain rare regions
* Ammunition 
* Gunpowder - Possibly made from (char)coal, sulfur and saltpeter which must be mined, may be dangerous to store
* Other intermediate products i.e bricks
* Clothing and tools would be stored as resources
* Water? Could just be envisioned as a utility
