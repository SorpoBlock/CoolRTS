Strength is a trait for [[Citizens]] that is to an extent determined randomly at a citizen's [[Birth]]. 
It will be lower when citizens are younger before reaching its maximum, and will slowly decrease as the citizen grows old. 
Performing manual [[Tasks]] and [[Jobs]] (i.e. early game [[Mining]]) will increase strength slowly over time, but will be soft-capped by the citizens strength at birth.
Female citizens will have a soft-cap about 20% lower than male citizens. 
Hunger will prevent strength from growing or decrease it very slowly over time.

Strength will allow units to have a greater maximum [[Stamina]] as well as move faster and carry more. They will be able to perform manual tasks with greater speed. 

Strength will become less important in the [[Technology|latter stages of the game]], as tasks and jobs become industrialized and melee [[Tools|weapons]] are replaced with guns.
