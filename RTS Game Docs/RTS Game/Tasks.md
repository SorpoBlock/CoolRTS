Tasks are discrete activities that can be assigned manually to [[Citizens]], they do not reset [[Experience]] and do not benefit from any sort of experience modifier. They are distinct from [[Jobs]] which citizens are assigned to once and do automatically in perpetuity, gaining experience in their current Job and losing experience in their previous jobs.

Tasks may include:
[[Terraforming]] i.e. digging a trench or paving a road
Transporting [[Resources]] of any kind whether automatically or manually.
Moving somewhere, waiting somewhere, or driving [[Vehicles]] 
Gathering certain simple resources like water or pre-generated [[Food]] i.e. berries or something
