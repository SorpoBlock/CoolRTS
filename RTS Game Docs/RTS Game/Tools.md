[[Citizens]] can each carry only one primary tool at a time, which determines their [[Jobs]]. They will have a secondary slot for tools related to [[Tasks]] (i.e. shovel) and either ammunition of grenades in [[Combat]]. These tools can usually be made from different [[Resources|materials]] to improve their quality, in other words how quick jobs/tasks can be done and how efficient they are at using resources/stamina. They may or may not have durability, but if they do it will be subtle and may be realized as a very slow decrease in tool quality, rather than total tool loss. Tool quality should also be affected by the [[Experience]] of the Citizen making it. 

Tools can be divided into two categories, [[Combat|military]] and civilian.
There should be a relatively short list of weapon types, with variation within types limited to the resource/metal used to create them, and the quality given by their creator's experience. 
For combat, we have:
* Primary weapons
	* Clubs
		* Simple, can be made from wood easily (but also metal if you want?)
		* Deal less damage, very dependent on unit [[Strength]] and [[Stamina]]
		* Mitigated by plate armor
	* Swords
		* Made from metal (copper,bronze,iron,steel)
		* Require a bit of extra processing to turn metal -> sword
		* Mitigated by plate armor
		* Not quite as dependent on strength and stamina
	* Spear
		* Like swords, but longer range and less damage and stamina use
	* Bows
		* Made from wood and maybe cloth/cotton/wool?
		* Relatively cheap
		* Heavily dependent on user's strength and stamina
		* Inaccurate like musket
		* Mitigated greatly by armor
		* Use arrows
	* Muskets
		* Use simple tin (our version of lead) ammunition
		* Inaccurate
		* Made from wood + metal, only moderate processing needed
		* Only a bit of damage mitigation from chainmail or plate armor
	  * Rifle (i.e. bolt action or semi-auto)
		  * Uses tin or bronze (our version of brass) ammunition
		  * Significantly more processing required to create
		  * Quality heavily dependent on creator's experience
		  * Made almost entirely of steel
	  * Automatic rifles
		  * Even harder to make than rifles
		  * Very late game product
		  * Uses ammo really quickly
		  * Used mostly for suppression, which is a distinct action to normal fire
		  * [[Formations]] will have unique 'suppression' policies you can set
  * Secondary weapons:
	  * Use a spear as a javelin by putting it in secondary slot?
	  * Pistol
		  * Middle ground between musket and semi-auto rifle in terms of quality and cost
		  * Uses separate ammunition type
		  * Can be switched to when out of primary ammo
	  * Grenades
		  * Can be used manually to attack a location, or set as per a formation policy
		  * Made with gunpowder and a bit of metal
		  * Maybe different kinds, like frag or HE
		  * Great at destroying [[Building|buildings]] / [[Infrastructure]] 

Citizens will be able to carry a certain amount of ammo apart from the primary and secondary slots. Ammo types will be limited to arrows of different metals, tin musket balls, and bronze rifle rounds.

For civilian tools:
* Primary slot
	* Note that for advanced creation jobs like blacksmith or machinist, their tools will most likely be part of the furnishing for the [[Building]] they work in
	* Pickaxe for mining
	* Axe for cutting trees
	* Hoe for farming
	* Hammer for building
	* Welding kit for late game metal building
	* Field medic supplies?
	* Fishing rod
* Secondary slot
	* Shovel, for [[Terraforming]]
	* Bucket or clay pot for transporting liquids
